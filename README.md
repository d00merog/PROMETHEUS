## Core Processing Framework

### 1. Quantum-Inspired Attention Mechanism

Extend classical attention mechanisms to incorporate quantum superposition:

```
QAttention(ψ, ϕ) = ∑_i α_i |ψ_i⟩⟨ϕ_i|
```

Where |ψ_i⟩ and |ϕ_i⟩ are quantum states representing query and key-value pairs, and α_i are complex amplitudes.

### 2. Hyperbolic Embeddings

Represent hierarchical information in hyperbolic space for more efficient encoding of complex structures:

```
d_H(x, y) = acosh(1 + 2||x - y||^2 / ((1 - ||x||^2)(1 - ||y||^2)))
```

Where d_H is the hyperbolic distance between points x and y in the Poincaré ball model.

### 3. Fractal Dimension Analysis

Assess information complexity using fractal dimension:

```
D = lim_{ε→0} log(N(ε)) / log(1/ε)
```

Where N(ε) is the number of self-similar structures at scale ε.

### 4. Quantum Bayesian Inference

Extend Bayesian inference to quantum states:

```
ρ_post = ∑_i E_i ρ_prior E_i† / Tr(∑_i E_i ρ_prior E_i†)
```

Where ρ_post is the post-measurement density matrix, ρ_prior is the prior density matrix, and E_i are measurement operators.

### 5. Non-Equilibrium Thermodynamics of Cognition

Model cognitive processes as far-from-equilibrium thermodynamic systems:

```
dS/dt = σ + Φ
```

Where dS/dt is the rate of entropy change, σ is entropy production, and Φ is entropy flux.

### 6. Topological Data Analysis

Use persistent homology to analyze the shape of data:

```
β_k(ε) = dim H_k(X_ε)
```

Where β_k(ε) is the k-th Betti number at scale ε, representing the number of k-dimensional holes in the data.

### 7. Quantum Circuit Learning

Implement quantum circuit-based machine learning:

```
U(θ) = ∏_i exp(-iθ_i H_i)
```

Where U(θ) is a parameterized quantum circuit, θ_i are trainable parameters, and H_i are Hamiltonian operators.

### 8. Adaptive Resonance Theory

Implement self-organizing neural networks for stable category learning:

```
ρ = |x ∧ w| / (α + |w|)
```

Where ρ is the choice function, x is the input vector, w is the weight vector, and α is the choice parameter.

### 9. Quantum Entropy Maximization

Maximize von Neumann entropy for quantum states:

```
S(ρ) = -Tr(ρ log ρ)
```

Where S(ρ) is the von Neumann entropy of density matrix ρ.

### 10. Tensor Network States

Represent high-dimensional data using tensor networks:

```
|ψ⟩ = ∑_{i_1,...,i_N} T_{i_1...i_N} |i_1...i_N⟩
```

Where T_{i_1...i_N} is a tensor representing the quantum state |ψ⟩.
